##Mr.Url
----

Mr.Url is a bookmarklet that all it does is letting you manage GET parameters in the Url through a pleasant interface. It is developed in just a few hours in order to make my job at work and bit easier and personalized, so don't expect too much.

You can get an idea of the interface by running on browser the .html file in `preview` folder  or by grabbing the current version [from here](http://devnews.uhurucloud.com/bookmarklets.html) if you don't feel like messing with the source code

No tests provided since it does only what I want it to do but if it happens to use it and you want to enrich it with some feature , please do so.


I just threw in there some cookie reader/writter for adding
